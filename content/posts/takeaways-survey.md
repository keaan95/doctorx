**Artificial intelligence** encompasses computational efforts to contain and harness the ability to perform tasks that traditionally humans would do through immense memory, power and calculation. This is a current reality in healthcare as clinical approval exists for common arrhythmia, breast density, diabetic retinopathy and focused lung pathology detection in the United States under the FDA.

## 0 State of Play

Instead of replacing the existing role of clinicians, recent FDA approved algortihms have nuanced roles in diagnosis and workflow optimisation. Whilst we as medical professionals can elect and choose decisions to make on patients through our intuition and experience, working with 'artificial intelligence' based-technologies can fundamentally allow us to make more informed and accurate decisions. These methods could be further applied to overcome diagnostic errors, avoid unnecessary procedures, burnout through optimising rotas and become predictive tools of deteriorating patients.

## 1 What Lies Beneath
Through utilising previous medical records and outcomes of patients, a wealth of digitised patient information can allow us to detect trends. These trends can be subtle to the human eye but are readily detectable by machines. These trends include patients who are likely to become septic, develop acute kidney injuries and possibly have COVID-19. These are just some of the common medical situations that current junior doctors are often embroiled with. The immediate reality is future doctors will be handling these computational tools built on extraordinary complexity.

## 2 Unanswered Questions

1. For us as future doctors, how prepared are we to use these computational methods?
2. Are we able to communicate the utility and role of these computational tools to patients?
3. Are we able to critically evaluate and challenge the role of these methods in our diagnostic and logistical reasoning processes?

*72 out of 77 (93.5%) Undergraduate Medical Students believe that they should have an understanding of the capabilities and limitations of AI. Sampled through our National UK Undergraduate Survey conducted from April - August 2020.*

Current medical students are readily believing the advancing capacities of artificial intelligence in healthcare. In particular, that AI can offer more safe, standardised and cost-effective care. The implementation of AI algorithms into clinical workflows is dependent on robust prospective clinical trials - allowing us to measure of the effect of an intervention compared to the current standard. Alongside contemporary healthcare's extensive technical, logistical and economic concerns, more pressure is now placed on clinicians to disseminate advanced technological evidence presented in many variable study designs to answer common clinical questions. Simply alongside clinical expertise and experience, will AI algorithms offer a substantial improvement to our clinical practice.

## 4 Overcoming this Divide

*6 out of 77 (0.078%) students have ever experienced any formal teaching or education [intra or extra-curricular] on the role of Artificial Intelligence in healthcare.*



Skills in equipping future clinicians and critical appraisal have long been advocated for in undergraduate curriculums. These analytical skills are often considered in evaluating sources of bias, particularly surrounding the use of artificial intelligence algorithms. Efforts to build competency in interpreting and explaining AI results have been offered by the University of Toronto who lead education workshops surrounding AI covering clinical issues in ethics, interpretability and harnessing big data. By distinguishing clearer curricular and extra-curricular objectives to stimulate educational needs and interests, it is conceivable more future doctors will be better prepared to work alongside AI tools.

### 4 Importance Now

As a core element of their training, it remains fundamental that future doctors are able to communicate and reason their concerns and expectations, surrounding diagnoses and treatment, both to colleagues and families. Clinical communication stations at medical school classically cover judicious antibiotic use, medication reviews and risk-benefit discussions. However, they are yet to cover patient and familial concerns into an algorithmic's result. Given the advancing role of AI into influencing these decisions and wider misinformation and misunderstanding surrounding AI, it is not inconceivable such situations will become more commonplace.


### 5 Improving the Curriculum

Whilst detailed critical appraisal and close technical evaluation of algorithms may remain an interest for vested medical students, underlying conjecture surrounding AI algorithms exists both in the public and in those in healthcare professionals. What really does AI mean for healthcare? How will it really impact healthcare?  

It is clear that our evidence-based practice is becoming increasingly informed by artificial intelligence. Movements in evidence-based medicine suggest a clear need for us as clinicians to actively seek out uncertainties in patient care - not simply mechanically following rules but instead by beginning to unpack the reasons for why decisions have been made. The real pressure is on a methods to alleviate this pressure on clinicians. Thus, it may be possible for clinicians to be better prepared to explain and communicate outputs of algorithms to our patients.

### 6 Taking off this Pressure 

Extra-curricular initiatives will continue to provide students with a better understanding on how AI will significantly advance healthcare decisions. This all collectively adds to an enriched knowledge base to support a more informed undergraduate curriculum that will enable all future doctors to become better prepared.

In May 2020, I founded [DoctorX.co.uk](https://www.doctorx.co.uk). This is a national network of university students from a diverse range of relevant degree backgrounds across the UK who are keen on better understanding the impact of delivering artificial intelligence into healthcare. This project investigates:

- How will Artificial Intelligence really help healthcare?
- How can we overcome current concerns and limitations of delivering healthcare with artificial intelligence?
- How can we best prepare future professionals for working within this field?
- What steps can we make to support and develop artificial intelligence systems in future healthcare?

Students of any degree background and experience level are very welcome to become part of DoctorX. We are planning a series of articles, journal clubs and video discussions - [join here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=yRJQnBa2wkSpF2aBT74-h4_904xzEU1Hr6_KZJuPREVUMVBXUzZaRVpIMktET1dEWTI0TlBXR0NBTC4u).
