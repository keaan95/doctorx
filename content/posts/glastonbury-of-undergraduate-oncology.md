## Back to Cambridge
**Friday**
\
7pm. We're off to Cambridge for a Poster Presentation at the Cambridge University Oncology Society Conference. Short delay at Peterborough provided enough time to join in the Academic Medicine Society Committee Video Call - plans for the Conference are being mapped out. Great to give back on some of my experiences from the year before to students now planning their first Conference. Otherwise, just flicking through Reproductive Health notes from the day before. Sister messages me ask 'You coming to Cambo?!?!' Oh dear [she's a NatSci Graduate from Churchil College so she's on top of the lingo]. Navigating through this leads to a shared agreement that I will pop in to see here in Wagamama with her boyfriend.

7.30pm. Arriving at Cambridge Train Station. Lots of suitcases but I'm here with a rucksack and poster rolled up. Drop off the kit at Travelodge and head on down to Wagamama. Spot my sister and her boyfriend. Good catch-up. Otherwise, I'm out of here. Subway will do.

**Saturday**.

Conference Day. Lots of attendees (~60). Poster presentation at 12pm with a 3 minute poster speech. Went well. Hit the major points I wanted to cover over two months of hard work in Machine Learning Classifers of a high-risk of tumour relapse subtype of ALL. Lots of limitations to my research and felt it was important to unpack a few of those. Above all else in research - especially in a coding project - your code needs to be reproducible and methodology defendable. So c'mon kid listen to the advice from years ago and put it on github! After a Costa Coffee and WhatsApp message to the family, there are significant reasons to remain optimistic. Leeds Conference in Medical Education in March is the next one.
