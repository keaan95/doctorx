## the graduate way

3+4
3+1+5
4+5
1+5

the amount of years one can be spending studying at university until they are qualified as a doctor in the UK. it is a long ass haul.
\
\
every doctor in healthcare will know of another doctor taking an unusual route to medicine. this is <b>the graduate way</b>.

### 3+4 (three years UG + graduate-entry medicine)

pros: the most common template. three years of biomed. four years of medicine. bish bash bosh. you're in healthcare.
\
\
disadvantages: four year medical degree courses are notoriously competitive - limited places and high admission scores required. depending on the uni, the first year is basically your only pre-clinical year so can mean two years squished in one. intense but not impossible. you've got this far after all.

### 3+1+5 (three years UG + one year elsewhere + five year medicine)

pros: wedge a different non-uni / non-typical degree year in between your studies. a common tip given to many 20 year olds is to go travelling so why not do a different degree / new university / new job for a year.
\
\
disadvantages: a five year UK course will mean you have to pay tuition fees for at least four of those years. a five year course will mean you should try and make friends with the younger ones - mentorship and welcome drinks and all that.

### 4+5 (four years UG + five years medicine)

pros: a four year undergrad suggests you've done a placement year, pharmacy, opthalmology, nursing, physiology or an extended undergrad with an integrated masters - so you've probably got some skills beyond a typical undergraduate.
\
\
disadvantages: you've spent a decade in uni, possibly without a job. that's simply a lot of debt racked up. taxes are coming and you better have a plan for that compounding interest rate.

### 1+5 (one year biomed transfer + five years medicine)

pros: the hollywood option. time and financially efficient. you may miss out on the BSc but tuition fees should be covered.
\
\
disadvantages: the rarest pokemon (7 out of 300 in my medical school year were transfers). uni admissions can play with places and requirements - even during the application cycle so be prepared to do the full degree at worst.


## so what's the takeaway
graduate medicine is long, can be increasingly competitive depending on the course and university you apply to.
\
\
if you're 18, i would really recommend you to evaluate the financial implications of taking on potenially a five year medical course and paying the tuition fees.
\
\
if you're 21 and post-graduate, if a four year course is your only option, there are private loans and charities available to help with the five year option.
\
\
if you're 26 and post-medical school, i hope you've enjoyed university because its time to start paying taxes.
\
\
university is fun but costly. lots of experiences, skills and reflections to take onto your next job. so live it up.
