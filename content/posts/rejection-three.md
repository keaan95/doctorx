## rejection #3
From Leicester this time. Simply another low UKCAT score.

Last Saturday, went to London to a MedicPortal organised MMI circuit to gain experience with MMIs and it was absolutely worthwhile. I smashed the Breaking Bad News station - telling a mate that I lost his cat whilst he was away. Absolutely ballsed the describe diabetes station. I am a biomed. Oh yeah and i'm still shit at ethics.

But curiously, it is also the time of year when PhD interviews are taking place and it has been a consideration for me. Do I see myself enjoying the challenge of a PhD? Could i apply a little bit of it into my clinical career? Or would it be best to pursue it after medical school training when I've got direction of a clinical career? It is an option. But for the future for now.
