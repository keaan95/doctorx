Halfway Dinner of the Masters Degree at Cambridge tomorrow. Just 4 Assignments and a 10,000 word Thesis await. Plans for life after Cambridge are underway.

- Communication skills. Thinking more simply. Not trying to be overly articulate.
- Calmness under pressure. Never letting anything fluster you or your ability to perform.
