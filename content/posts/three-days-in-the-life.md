## three days in the Life
okay so this wasn't exactly during the junior doctor strikes. let's just say it was.

## huh?
*sorta like one of those week in the life things you see on youtube. except more bleak and boring but strangely more relateable*

### saturday
#### 6.45am
jump out of bed. fuck this can barely walk. this ankle sprain is no joke. this ain't no get-me-out-of-year 4 PE injury. can ankle sprains feel worse with age?

#### 11am
parkrun was a no-go. feeling like an absolute lemon. let's try to run. 

#### 1.30pm
full kit wanker. a wanna-be phil sesemann. 10 yards in the sun. nah bruv. you ain't running today. firstly, you ain't got the talent (big bulky leg strength talent that is). secondly, just go get a maccies. biscoff mcflurry is quite fit to be fair.

### sunday
#### 9am
right you little wasteman - you've got your sleep. ankle is still attached. let's have a banger.

#### 5.30pm
meal prep went well this week. until i just slammed in an asda lamb rogan josh. nonetheless we've got this cappucino flavoured muller lite yoghurt to smash into. mid-spoonful. the yoghurt is all over the desk. the group chat has erupted and poor sainath has taken an utter [violation](/posts/lad-culture).

#### 7pm
still laughing my tits off at the group chat. somehow with all the happy juice - my ankle feels alright - let's test it.

#### 8pm
warm up complete. ankle's tight but loosens after strides. let's try a 10k run.

#### 9pm
10k in the bank. bus pulls in. thank the heavens. as soon as i get on the bus. a 40 year old woman blurts out - 'oh my goodness, you look like nick kyrgios!' time for bed.

### monday
#### 8am
back on sleep. back on the regular foods. a scrumptious home-built ham and cheese ciabatta sourced from the finest yellow labels in the land. emails flying in. dad's like you're in luck. what? rebate from the government! shit now i can afford a house deposit on a rental for next week. spreadsheet time.

#### 7pm
tenancy application email all neatly completed. double. triple. quadruple checked. not normally this over the top. but man, with this dodgy ankle - a good property is all i have.

#### 8pm
hobblin back into my room after slamming in a crosta mollica guilt-free. hajra's like 'what happened to you.' i'm dieing.
