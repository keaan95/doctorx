## welcome to research.

{{< quote info >}}
`research` - `re-search` (english?): a way to improve beyond standards that exist.


**disclaimer**:  it is a grind and a heck of a lot of sweat.

### A Sprinkle of Inspiration
University is a big pond. In fact, its an ocean. You can go as deep or as shallow as you'd like. No one's gonna know. No one's gonna care. Anyway, I like to check out the Faculty Blog. At Plymouth University, this is conveniently titled the 'Biomedical Science Blog.' So one day in 2014, I find a student - a final year student - a student who is now a PhD student at **Cambridge**. Unreal. A Plymouth undergrad - now a postgrad at Cambridge. As a bright-eyed first year biomed, I was mightily impressed.

### Ask Questions
I had no idea how to pick out a supervisor or even a topic of interest. In fact, I just went for the author of the 'Biomedical Science Blog,' at Plymouth University. The man kindly invited me for a meeting. Knocked on his door. Ah, could you come back in 15 minutes. No worries - I'll be back.

15 minutes go by. I'm back. Now, I can honestly tell you I cannot recall a lot in this meeting. All I remember was personalised healthcare through genomes. Here's a load of genetic sequences and this is what might change clinical healthcare. It was mesmorising. At the end of it all, in my daze, the tutor said - 'Look, if you don't understand what's going on, you need to ask more questions.'

<br /><br />

Hard truth. But its the ***power of research***. There's always more questions than answers. If you don't know what the fuck's going on, I bet you a load of other people don't either. So ask the question.

### What is *Your* Question
This is probably the hardest part of the puzzle. Defining the fucking question you're asking. I come from big data - you get the data, poke around and come up with a question. Of course, old school science says come up with the question, get the data and poke around. However you go about it, you gotta speak to others - your peers, fellow lab members and supervisors. Is what I have meaningful? Will it add to the literature? Am I best placed to answer it?

<br /><br />

`Know yo question better than yo know your wife.`

### The Handover
Two parts to a handover. The hand and the over. Not sure where I'm going with this. Anyway, to kickstart your work - some of the most valuable time is spent with the person already working on a similar project or the one you're about to work on. They'll have an awareness of problems and processes that probably no one else on earth will be aware of.
<br /><br />
And on the opposite side, once you've put your research shift in - what bits can be taken on further? In other words, who's gonna finally bring the publication(s) home and how are they gonna do it? **Make a manual** - a minimum level of detail so readers can understand what was done - so one can critically appraise and replicate. I've said some big words there. That's enough for now.
