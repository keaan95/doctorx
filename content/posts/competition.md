## Introduction
my timer didn't work today. you what mate? did a half-marathon running race and my timer didn't register. cool.

### right so there are two battles in life
one is the guy opposite from you. and two is the guy inside of you.
\
\
once you control the the guy inside of you - the guy opposite you has no chance.
\
\
**that is all competition should be. you against you.**

### where are you going with this?
so this is all bit like a 'control the controllables' - in life all you can do is control the controllables. i can't control my chip timer - but i can control the effort i put into my running.

### so what's the takeaway
compete with yourself. try and be better each day. don't worry or focus on others. just get strava and chat shit.
