## hang about
4 blogs in 4 days? that ankle sprain must be hitting hard. slight nervous anxiety with the ongoing tenancy application tbf. the spreadsheet confirms expected in-goings of £2,000 and expected out-goings of £1,970. budget outlook grim.

### background
a few months ago - faith, a work colleague, was giving me a look of slight disdain. a look of what the hell. she's like - 'doctorx, how are you so happy?' rambled off a little speech about 'you got money, some mates and you're in the pub - life's good.'
\
\
months later - money's tight, mates are hit and miss and its just not pub weather right now. but if you're still happy somehow - there must be more to this.

### what you need to be happy
back in the school-days. as a little activities 16 year old director bouncing around the nursing home in summer. an old man's like 'come, let me tell you something.' didn't really think twice but i was excited to hear what's next. so you need three things to be **happy**:

- someone to talk to. if you haven't got it - there's always the dog.
- something to look forward to. always have something in the diary.
- a sense of **purpose**. this is the hardest one. but it will come with time.

### right what is your sense of purpose?
so i was thinking through this and i haven't fully fleshed out a quick answer. but at the route of it - its what can you offer the world.
\
\
and a good starting block to help figure this out - what's unique about you compared to the average guy of your age. well that's it. fuckin' embrace it. i'm currently a happy runner who chats shit. back in the day a nerdy wayward biomed / medical student sweating out over his cv. and i think once you begin to accept who you are and what you've got. you naturally will be like - you know what - i'm alright. *now if you got mates who are like mate you got problems or worse still don't talk to you - soz you're beyond my help.*

### so that's it?
well you've got to work hard. and by that i mean work hard on what you've got. give it everything. if its sports, if its arts, if its wine-tasting, if its a niche appreciation for belgian house music - just go hard. coz if you do, you'll get satisfaction - because you will improve. you'll figure out what you like - what you don't like. and boom - something that initially felt like work may one day feel like a hobby.

### so in summary
find a purpose -> work hard at it -> at some point if you like some parts of it - it will become a hobby. chat to your mates. share your passions. we're social-ass creatures. coz the beauty of happiness is that its often stored in relationships. so your happiness can make someone else happy. isn't that nice.

right its cocktail hour.
