## so how's it going?
got a dodgy hip - first big running injury limiting my distance running - but a huge improvement in being able to put load on it since last Sunday.

## that's it?
Well the flat had a burst water main - and it was massive to be fair - the only way of coping through it was laughter - just how ridiculous the whole situation was while we waiting for the plumber who was 2 hours away. and when the plumber arrived, he just said fuck it and had a cigarette.

## right how's the day job?
well the challenge for me is just meeting the expectations i have of myself AND trying to meet the standards that people have of you. i'm a bit of a duracell bunny 'hopping around' or as the pharmacist called me 'doctor kamikaze.' not sure what i've just said there to be fair.

## maintaining the professional persona
when you're tired - you will say silly things and try and poke comments out of people for a reaction - let's not rate how fun the F1s are on a scale of 1 to 10 one month in - just remember to take your 9 hours of sleep - sleep is a debt that can't really be paid back. your body will be better for it.

## friends moving away
the 'fun' friends as I like to call them have all moved out. maybe its me that's not so fun anymore ahaha. anyway good news is running mates are real - you're voluntarily showing up in the heaving rain to run around in circles. that's my [tribe](/posts/isle-of-wight).

## are you behaving at social drinks?
well trying to. being the happy inclusive guy rather than the 'one-up guy' - continuing to try and be self-aware of weird comments - i mean look - who is most likely to get divorced is not quite the question to bring up at the first team social.
