## insights from the phd boys
![image](/images/phd-boys.jpg)
the sun is out. Springtime in Newcastle has never seemingly looked so good in early February.

A relaxing weekend back home also included a trip back to Cambridge to visit the old stomping grounds - Wolfson Court. Sadly, it is in a early stage of disrepair after closing down just after we left last summer.

nonetheless, three of the Girton Boys are motoring on with PhDs, two are in employment and one is at Medical School (me). PhD students also have the unique responsibility of supervising young undergraduate students - called 'supervisions.'

anyway, so what these phd supervisors find fascinating is when students come up with perspectives - different to the supervisor. so what if we think about things in this way? i dare admit that i've spent five years of uni literally regurgitating slide material and just piecing together a vaguely fluent essay. but rarely do i think why is this way the best way? or is there a better way? or what could we do differently? some individuals have an amazing ability to grasp and understand new concepts and pick out relevant questions. just sheer admiration for these guys. its a bit of a weakness. a thought process or reasoning ability that is not quite as innate in me but maybe in time will improve.
