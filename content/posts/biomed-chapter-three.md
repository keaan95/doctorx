### so what did you learn this year eh?
- Societies make things happen
- Drunk Mario Kart
- Living in The Coffee Room
- 73.5% average - Top of the Class?

#### Societies
Mid-November. A new position pops up on the Biomedical Science Committee. Its the 'Academic Secretary.' Murmurs going around the Biomed boys. Who's gonna apply? It turns, three of us. And it turns out, two of us tie. It goes down to a Committee vote. Your humble diary boy vs. the high-powered Biomedical Science Rep. The unknown vs. the proven. And soo...
\
\
I got elected Academic Secretary of the Biomedical Science Society. Months later. I ask the President - why did you take me? Wanted to see what you could do.
\
\
Fun story. Plymouth Union elections were going on. One of the candidates is call Jess Vagg. Someone got a two-bed mattress cover and wrote 'Vote for Vagg' and draped it right in the middle of the biggest walkway on campus. She won by a landslide.

#### Drunk Mario Kart
You need a housemate that's got the kit. The four player FIFA sesh, the four player mario kart. Dan's the man.
\
\
You also need a housemate that appreciates you've had one too many. Ketchup shots. Dan's the man.

#### The Coffee Room
I'm on the hustle. Friday and Saturday nights. Pumping in the hours in the library. Coursework, lecture notes and chatting shit with the library regulars. One day in Mid-February, walk into the library. The usuals are missing. Chem Cave is not around. The internationals aren't around. Not a biomed in worldview. I park at my usual desk. Flick on the power and dunk my head into the laptop. The date Saturday February 14th 2015.

`One small regret actually is I didn't go out on any housemeals with my second or third year biomed housemates. No matter how shit or great your group is. You gotta get a restaurant meal in. You'll be so glad you did in years gone by.`

#### Top of the Class?
You've chatted big about your library attendance. Did it pay off? Well, you got a **73.5%** average. Gotta eek out that .5.
\
\
But...top spot goes to another lad - a mature student, who smashed out an **80%**. Unreal. One day in the library Coffee Room, I tell Jason. Look man, this guy. I'm gonna beat him out. Just watch.
