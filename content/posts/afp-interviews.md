## afp interviews!

### interview outcomes - 12/01/2022

brilliant. and that wraps that up. two rejections.

walking to the common room. a short walk from the accom block. read a notification that my oriel was updated. i knew exactly what was going on. a slight smirk.

### why aren't you so excited?
well it was tempting but for a few months i've been leaning away from academia as an early career interest. publication pressure and all.

and more honestly, its just not what my skillset is. i thought for years academia is me but its [just not me](/posts/end-of-medical-school).

### you've waited years for this and this is it?
one day i'll make a more beautifully put post about the afp process but there's many more opportunities out there. hopefully will smash the sjt and get london.

### and did you smash the sjt?
nope - i'm [on the isle of wight](/posts/isle-of-wight)
