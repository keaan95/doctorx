## end of year one biomed.

![image](/images/first-year.jpg)

just before my parents were about to head off after dropping off all my crap. my dad says 'make some friends.' cheeky git.



### so what did you learn this year eh?
- Pay for your laundry mate. You stink.
- Flat chemistry is the juju
- Three tubes of jelly tots will give you a crippling migraine.
- Top of the Class?

#### Clean Clothes
Not paid for my laundry at all this year. Not proud about it. Not shameful about it.

Also probably don't use the vacuum that's already hoovered up sick.

#### Flat Chemistry
Stirring up some good house banter, squeezing out all the juicy gossip from months back and chatting shit until the early hours. Cannot understate how much fun a great group is.<br><br>

But what is a great group? Mutual commitment. It doesn't take a lot. Wanna go out? Sure. Wanna remake I'm a Celeb in the Kitchen? Sure. Wanna watch Russian Ice Hockey and bet on Virtual Horse Racing? Definitely.

#### Jelly Tots
Your flatmates will be in disbelief. How is this skinny, average height, average looks guy <strike>getting all the girls</strike> not getting fat. Just wait till second year mate. TLDR this kid gets fat.

#### 68% Degree Average
Been cruising along this year and keeping things ticking over. Smashed out a 47% in one of my exams. Yet I've cranked out a **68%**. I guess my patient leaflets have been banging.<br><br>
I know one day I'd love to study medicine and I also love a bit of [research](/posts/research). (I remember thinking to myself back in 2014), If I really push myself at this degree - maybe hit top of the class, there's no way they can reject me.
