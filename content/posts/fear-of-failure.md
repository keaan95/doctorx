## fear of failure
We are officially two-thirds into this nine year projected voyage through university. That means just three years left to complete some goals. The next one - a first author publication.
\
\
Simply what a time to be doing some summer research. Lots of data. Lots of information. Tutorials. Anyway, there's just so much many more ways to churn through data in the field of machine learning.
\
\
And so it all begins with an abstract.
\
\
I will not be the first guy who spends nine years at university with no first-author publication. That will not be me. Years later it was me.
