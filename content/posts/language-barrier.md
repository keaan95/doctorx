There is a growing language divide between the üë®üèª‚Äçüç≥ ‚Äòmakers,‚Äô üë®üèª‚Äçüè´ ‚Äòteachers‚Äô and üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏èüë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è ‚Äòusers‚Äô of artificial intelligence (AI). This divide has been explained as the **explainability** and **interpretability** problem that leads many to misunderstand what AI is, what it truly involves, its current applications and likely repercussions.

## 1 Explainability

Explainability is the process of building greater transparency between 'makers,' 'teachers,' and 'users.' Each of these groups of people have a purpose. For example, 'makers' want to ensure explainability of their pilot scheme for testing and proof purposes. 'Users' such as 'medics' want to understand its integration into clinical workflows and how it impacts on their clinical reasoning skills. 'Teachers' will want to know what 'themes' students will need to learn to help students develop their own critical analysis and reasoning skills.

## 2 Interpretability

Interpretability is the process of overcoming the technical challenge of explaining model outputs between 'makers, 'teachers,' and 'users.' Each of these groups will have various experience levels and subsequently confidence levels with the input and output of AI models. Similarly, can we convey our understanding of the output and role of the output to our patients care and to the wider public. Ensuring interpretability carries the risk of defaulting of oversimplifying our language where we can mislead users leading to misconceptions and a greater information gap.

## 3 Teacher-Student Language Divide

A balance between what people *want to know* and *should know* is leading to a growing explainability and interpretability problem in educating students about AI, especially in healthcare, where AI remains in its relative infancy.

Questions students may consider - Are students aware of AI? If they are now, what do students feel that they should know more about? How passionately do they feel about the area? To what extent, will this make them better doctors?

Questions teachers may have about students - Do students need to be really aware of the capabilities and limitations of AI in healthcare? Do they need teaching principles of AI as applied to healthcare, capabilities and limitations of AI? Do they need teaching on biases in patient selection and intervention design or statistical skills to interpet research results beyond that of just AI?

## 4 Overcoming this Divide

The COVID-19 pandemic has brought increased attention to artificial intelligence and predictive mathematical modelling as part of a combined effort to inform governmental and medical response to the infection. During and post-COVID-19, there has been a reactional push for healthcare to become increasingly digitised. I wanted to assess whether other medical students were interested in an increasing role of technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare and its implications.

### 4.1 Live National COVID-19 Survey

Previously, medical students have reported mixed perceived confidence levels in critically using and analysing AI. Howver, given COVID-19, it was hypothesised that student perceptions towards the application of technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the future may have changed.

Our [LIVE National Survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=yRJQnBa2wkSpF2aBT74-h4_904xzEU1Hr6_KZJuPREVUMFMzQVNaVjU3NTQwMkxUSE4yN1RPSFhTRy4u) of Medical Students evaluates student confidence with various applications of AI in healthcare during and after COVID-19. This survey also assesses students' feeling of preparedness to work with artificial intelligence during their careers and whether wider teaching of AI principles, basic data research and statistical skills should be included into medical school curriculums.

### 4.2 National Network of Interested Students

Given this transition to more digitised healthcare that integrates artificial intelligence, I believe that we should strive to become more fluent with technology and overcome this language barrier. How can I get more students involved?

In May 2020, I founded [DoctorX.co.uk](https://www.doctorx.co.uk). This is a national network of university students from a diverse range of relevant degree backgrounds across the UK who are keen on better understanding the impact of delivering artificial intelligence into healthcare. This project investigates:

- How will Artificial Intelligence really help healthcare?
- How can we overcome current concerns and limitations of delivering healthcare with artificial intelligence?
- How can we best prepare future professionals for working within this field?
- What steps can we make to support and develop artificial intelligence systems in future healthcare?

Students of any degree background and experience level are very welcome to become part of DoctorX. We are planning a series of articles, journal clubs and video discussions - [join here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=yRJQnBa2wkSpF2aBT74-h4_904xzEU1Hr6_KZJuPREVUMVBXUzZaRVpIMktET1dEWTI0TlBXR0NBTC4u).
