### last day before the bleep
Welcome to your new job - from today you will be DoctorX. You'll get a bleep. You'll get responsibility. You'll get stuff wrong. You'll get stuff right. Don't be too hard on yourself. Work at 80% - and you know your 80% because you've run around full-time as a healthcare assistant for years. Support and check on your colleagues.
\
\
If in doubt, communicate your thoughts - in particular your concerns!
\
\
And remember, remember to always take a break - a snack, some water, lucozade, coffee.
\
\
Continue to enjoy your time off - do things that interest you, not what everyone else seems to be doing.
\
\
Remember the goals you have - no matter how ridiculous they may seem - because look how far you've come - DoctorX MBBS BSc (Hons) MPhil
