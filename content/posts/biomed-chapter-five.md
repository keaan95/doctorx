## Final Year Scores
Personal Research Project: **72.34%**
\
Molecular and Cellular Pathology: **74.17%**
\
Specialist Biochemistry and Screening: **79.13%**
\
Current Developments in Biomedical Science: **68.25%**
\

And those marks wrap up a **First Class Degree** which I am certainly very pleased about. For the first time, I finally have the academic criteria box firmly ticked. A third attempt at the UKCAT awaits and I am also close to finding out about my Masters application. Exciting times ahead.
