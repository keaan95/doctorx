## motivation

{{< quote info >}}
`motivation` - `motivus` (latin): a reason or reasons for acting or behaving in a particular way.

**Disclaimer**: a load of juice - and who doesn't like juice.

### so do i need it?
so do i need motivation? or is it more discipline? it seems like motivation is the juice, discipline is like the water. you probably need juice otherwise too water is boring.

### so what's your juice
- a-levels
- undergrad biomed
- gosh i sound boring


#### a-levels (2011-2013)
a-levels were a bit messy. one bad year of sixth form and boom you've got BCC. yet i knew i wanted to study medicine, and i believed i could do it in the uk as a graduate vs. going elsewhere [european](/posts/europeanmedicine). but never did i ever want to experience a feeling of failure like my a-levels again.

#### undergrad biomed (2013-2016)
my undergraduate degree really helped prove to myself that I can [compete](/posts/competition). after the first year of my undergraduate degree, i finished with just under a 69% average. after not particularly working hard in [first year](/posts/biomed-chapter-two), it was very reinforcing to me that with a little more application, I had self-belief go on and be one of the best students in my degree cohort - even if your tutor does not believe in you.

#### masters cambridge (2016-)
i actually am boring. :)
