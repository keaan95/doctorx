## healthcare assistant
after three medical school rejections (yet to hear from Southampton), i've decided to apply for **full-time healthcare assistant** work. I've applied to four different posts (Orthopaedics at one Hospital, two community based clinics and Emergency Department at another Hospital). a bit rogue for a postgrad but a bit needed for a kid without any real job experience.

### the interview
tucked away on the gastroenterology ward in the sister hospital of the one i'm applying to. the nurses were extremely kind and warming. the one question i can recall was imagine you've got a call bell going off, relative at reception and task you're halfway doing. how do you prioritise it? i think just being able to more coherently present myself really paid off. i felt more pressure at the first [medical school interview](/posts/rejection-one) - but this one felt like a situation where i've got nothing to lose. at the end, the nurses asked - do you feel ready to work in an A&E department? absolutely.
### the outcome
anyway news from today is that I have a **conditional offer of appointment to be a Healthcare Assistant in the Emergency Department**!
\
\
just sheer relief that ethics and interview practice has paid off and I'm extremely excited to now proudly become an NHS employee.
\
\
And so hopefully this begins a long career in hospital-based healthcare. Medical school applications await in upcoming months but healthcare assistant work is something new to look forward to.
