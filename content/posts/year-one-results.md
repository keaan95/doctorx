## year one results.
Passed.
Ranked **267/456**
\
6 OSCE stations passed with 1 fail (CPR).


### so what?
just a relief to have passed but a tinge of disappointment with my overall ranking. OSCE and SBA marks overall were below average and SAP just above average.

### digging deeper
surprised to score highly in the more social medicine-based paper (SAP - 65%) than in the more scientific paper (SBA - 61%). biomed no more.
\
\
**Spaced repetition** (we love that buzzword) proved useful in memorising key definitions and concepts but a lack of knowledge of finer more biomedical details was evident. Clearly a need to structure learning throughout the year and effectively use mindmaps to draw out areas that are not as well understood, flashcards to test learning and write out answers to questions on definitions, symptoms and common pathologies. My tutor would be proud of that reply.
\
\
A lack of continued **OSCE preparation** throughout the year proved to be costly. If you fail to prepare, prepare to fail and BLS was no surprise. Remembering to wash hands, ask for consent and systematically work through. Being fluent and taking time to think especially in examinations and patient histories will be elements to improve upon for next year (also don't get smashed on the beers and kebabs the night before an OSCE).

### all in all

A similar story to the [end of year one biomed](/posts/biomed-chapter-two). Back to being average with a lot more to prove. Margins are a lot closer in this degree but i feel the rewards are significantly greater - an academic doctor maybe?
