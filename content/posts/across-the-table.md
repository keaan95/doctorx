## middle of the pack
sibling rivalry is real. whether you feel it, want to believe it, want to talk about it. its there. one kid's achievements will get attention at the dinner table. how the kid reacts is always up to them.
\
\
across the table from me is my sister - as we're revising over easter. she's received numerous academic awards, 10 A*s at GCSE, 4 A*s at A-Level and a Natural Sciences graduate at Cambridge University. She had goals and visions and she has accomplished them - first time, without fault and usually before me. she also passed her driving test, attained a publication and got into Cambridge - all before I did. she's mega. the smartest kid i know. the smartest kid i'll ever know.
\
\
and so she is currently the 2nd ranked student in her first year of her accelerated dental degree. she's flying.
\
\
and as a sibling, i knew she was the one. the one who's gone for goals and achieved them. my goals have also been clear but taken longer. i eventually did pass my driving test, (still working on a publication) and also i got into cambridge. there are somedays where i wish i could achieve goals a bit more straightforwardly like she does but maybe that's the story of me?
\
\
i guess sibling rivalry is the wrong word looking back. more sibling admiration. that said, i'm still better than her at cod.
