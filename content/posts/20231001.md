this one's a reminder. a reminder to cook you lazy slob. sebastian, a top tier fourth year uni flatmate with catch potential, set the culinary standard. meanwhile after everything you've learnt - all you do is scavenge a frozen cannelloni, slurp on yellow label smoothies and stare at vaporflies all day.

### the groupp
but what a refresher tuscany was. an absolute treat. this one features the high energy uni group. yes the same final year group that came up with over [300 pub questions](/posts/pub-games) - tucked away in our excel spreadsheet. let's say hi

- emma - the hyper-organised farmer with an unmatched zest for life
- natalie - the queen orca but second favourite friend that your mum rates
- hannah - the church gal who can somehow get all the boys to come clean
- wing - the photographic maestro and elite email flirter

### siestas included
1. day one pisa - out the plane and out to check out leaning towers n all
2. day two lucca - charming town with charming parkrunners.
3. day three florence - 1 euro tram to see a peng cathedral. yes please.
4. day four villa n fine dinin' - i own a shirt.
5. day five greggs - bus was late. welcome back to the uk home boy.

### story tell not yell - 
- poolaroids - there's just a romance with a still frame oldie lens - you just have to make do with what you got. angles lighting filters 0191 do one.
- fuck bereal - could discuss this at length but frankly would rather be real.
- journal fuel - the latest on how do i stop ma younga sista getting engaged to an actual twat. hannah's sitch - the latest in her wine and whine journal. i did take notes
- moanopoly - 'yo wing you got a train station.' 'wing dont bother, u can't save the drowning man - not even a lifeboat could.' no casual renters on emma's property.
- wing attack - what lads can cover in five minutes the girlies may never cover. so wing odds on ordering a fruit shoot on our flight?


### next week's menu
- breakfast - greek yoghurt with peach and blackberry jam on an eggy croissaint
- lunch - skinny olive and feta with some sparkly pink grapefruit juice
- dinner - all business tuscan sausage pasta with a smooth white
- desert - seventy percent dark boy chocolate
