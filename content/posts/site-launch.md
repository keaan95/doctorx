**DoctorX** is a national collaboration of students from a diverse range of relevant degree backgrounds across the UK who are keen on better understanding the impact of delivering artificial intelligence into healthcare.

With a widening language divide between the ‘makers,’ ‘teachers’ and ‘users’ of artificial intelligence, we aim to clarify answers to:

- How will Artificial Intelligence really help healthcare?
- How can we overcome current concerns and limitations of delivering healthcare with artificial intelligence?
- How can we best prepare future professionals for working within this field?
- What steps can we make to support and develop artificial intelligence systems in future healthcare?

### Why is all this important?
Computer-based systems rapidly changing our modern-lives. From smartphone apps to wearable trackers to self-driving automobiles, these systems are also beginning to influence provision of healthcare. These systems, developed to tackle tasks normally handled by humans and encompass the intentions of 'artificial intelligence.' These methods have and will have continue to have a significant role and impact on the lives of current and future patients.

In a rapidly advancing era of digital healthcare, exacerbated by COVID-19, how prepared are medical doctors and future doctors for this? Are current students and future doctors aware of the uses of AI in healthcare? What do current students feel that they should know more about? How passionately do they feel about the area? To what extent, will this make them better learners, programmers and doctors?

### What can you do now?
To help prepare us for this, we are recruiting university students from mathematical, statistical, computer science, medical, biomedical and theoretical degree backgrounds to take part in a co-ordinated fortnightly effort to review the latest and most reliable evidence-base forms of artificial intelligence research. We will publish our weekly reports and perspectives to Doctorx.co.uk and to leading researchers globally.

Students of any degree background and experience level are very welcome to become part of DoctorX. We are planning to release regular articles, journal club excerpts and video discussions.
2. Complete our [LIVE National Survey](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=yRJQnBa2wkSpF2aBT74-h4_904xzEU1Hr6_KZJuPREVUMFMzQVNaVjU3NTQwMkxUSE4yN1RPSFhTRy4u) of Medical Students which evaluates student confidence with various applications of AI in healthcare during and after COVID-19. This survey also assesses students' feeling of preparedness to work with artificial intelligence during their careers and whether wider teaching of AI principles, basic data research and statistical skills should be included into medical school curriculums.
