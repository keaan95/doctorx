Critical appraisal is the systematic assessment and evaluation of the relative strengths and weakness of research papers. Skills in critical appraisal are considered imperative for all practitioners to grasp to improve the quality of provided care. These skills are especially critical for all future clinician-researchers to grasp at some point during their undergraduate or postgraduate education.

Recently implemented national journal clubs and educational programmes have found that medical students have experienced low confidence and performance with evaluating clinical literature. This is largely unsurprising given a continued lack of formal critical appraisal teaching opportunities, research experience amongst students and mounting pressure from other curricular commitments.

Immense improvements in the fields of **computing**, **genetics** and **mathematics** are dramatically driving growth in cancer-based literature and data output. One particular driver for these improvements is expanded use of computer-based artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, capable of harnessing these large data volumes. Clinical approval currently exists for breast density and focal lung pathology detection in United States. Working with these algorithms is beginning to dramatically alter how we can make more informed and accurate decisions as clinicians. As a consequence, greater pressure than ever is on future doctors who will be handling decisions based on computational tools of extraordinary complexity. 

## So what's the plan?

We plan to launch a five part Journal Club Series that covers recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning as applied to haematology, oncology and pathology.

But critically, what the pertinent papers that beginning to dramatically change care for cancer patients. What are the fields where impact is most iminent? How can we engage students based on their various interests in cancer.

Well our proposed exact structure has been built entirely by our committee at Newcastle Haematology, Oncology and Pathology Society. We'll take students on a round-robin and round-table discussion on:

- Background (PICO, main points, endpoints)
-	Data (collection, ethics and quality)
-	Methods (techniques, selection criteria, robustness of comparisons)
-	Validities and generalisabilities (trustworthiness and applicability to other situations).

This will all be integrated into a open discussion built around the paper. Of course, complete with the all important questions of what further steps could be made, where do we go next and whether this would lead to a change in practice. 

We're looking for Speakers and Academic Moderators with Cancer Interests across the following sub-specialties:

- Breast Cancer
- Leukaemia
- Bowel Cancer
- Lung Cancer
- Immunotherapy
