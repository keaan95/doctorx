### a bit of scene setting
![Memes](/images/running.jpg)
*i will hunt you down*

#### So you're a runner?
Yeah, I mean I had a tearful emotional moment on Wednesday night. When it dawned on me kinda that I am who I am. I am a fucking runner. I can fucking run.

#### So what?
To continue to be you. Try and be a source of happiness - identify friction points in life and tactfully find a way to address it. But more simply just do your fucking job. Because feedback has been amazing - Mr Rutter's tip - you can do whatever you set your mind to - but given your potential to do anything, you've also got the most potential to fuck things up. Yep that's gonna stick.

#### Is that it?
Well be there for your seniors. Seniors are seniors. They may appear firm and tough - but a bit cushy inside. Only half an hour ago they were juniors too.

#### So you're a good people person?
Nah, still a waffler.

#### So you're still a waffler?
I guess I really haven't changed. Just embraced more of who I am.

#### So what this week's takeaway?
Find a way to enjoy every hour - for me having a purpose and doing something towards my own health or future goals. Don't take yourself too seriously. Things will work out for you. Just keep chatting shit and running around.
