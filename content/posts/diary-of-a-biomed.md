## diary of an undergrad biomed

blogs are so brilliantly relateable. How else are you gonna find someone going through the same of emotions and circumstances whilst you're tucked up in your Lockdown Room sipping on Instant Cappucino. Long live the blog.

For me this, all this began as I have a lot fire from my Biomedical Science degree back in 2016. At lot of people counted me out including tutors. I just simply just wanted to get into Medicine. But if I didn't and my tutors were somehow provided right, at least I would be thorough in documenting the reasons why. Maybe someone else could do things a bit different and a bit better in their own journey.

### inspirational blogs
A blog called 'Grumpy Biomed' - a diary of a quintessential Biomedical Science student dreaming of studying medicine was read by me over 20 times perhaps. This was a time when YouTube videos did not exist on the matter. He also did a postgraduate masters but eventually got into Warwick for the 2011/12 Academic Year. There really wasn't anyone else who chronicled their feelings so regularly, beautifully and so relateably. That blog has since sadly been deleted and his follow-up medical school blog has gone too.

Last week, I came across Paeds Registrar who has just been awarded a Paeds Oncology Training Post. She has chronicled all her stories back to the penultimate year of medical school. A treasure trove of relateable emotion unlike these Productive Junior Doctor Gurus.

### to keep blogging?
Well we'll keep going - and four years later - it looks like i still have my [reasons](/posts/why-i-blog) why too.
