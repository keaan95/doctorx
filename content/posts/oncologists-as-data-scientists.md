Machine learning algorithms are fundamentally dumb. They are so heavily optimised to perform a task that whenever it is given something it hasn't seen before or more than one pathology, it fails. It is for this very reason why machine learning algorithms best performed under human observership. 

As humans we also have the same flaws and failures that algorithms do. But it is our ability to record, recognise and reason that means we can come to a conclusion. And with specialist support and judgement, make the best decision possible.

These very decisions are being built on more and more data. Instead of one report, how about a few different scans, a specialist blood report, a biopsy and a constellation of symptoms that might be treatment or tumour-related. AI/ML can offer us an opinion but it will remain up to the doctor (or more appropriately the MDT!) to factor this in to make the best decision possible.

## 0 Data to Treatment

This was a key takeway from the last weekend's Cambridge University Oncology Society Conference. Raj Jena, a consultant clinical oncologist declared that **future oncologists will be data scientists**. His team's work into analysing patient scans using deep learning algorithms are able to detect cancer pathology sooner - helping patients get treatment quicker.

If one were to dig into the patterns that define the ground-truth these algorithms use, it is measurement-based and probability-based. Its based on the probability of something being present in one particular aspect of the image, for example, expected sizes of tissue structures. Thus, we are building these machine learning tools and emulators of human performance to do tasks that traditionally humans would do.

For an algorithm to one day sensitively detect tissue changes comparable to that of an experienced radiologist, that is the very challenge.

## 1 Benefits and Risks of Experience

Machine learning models work best with human observation because these models actually fail similarly to how huamns do.

Keaan is a medical student diagnosing a pathology on a Chest X-Ray. He has a structure, some review areas in mind and through recognition and reason come to an answer. His experience is constained to what we've seen in textbooks or in a few months of clinical practice. He may struggle to pick up the abnormality or mis-classify it altogether. The same very errors that AI/ML models easily make.

So the challenge now exists for the trainee radiologist who has a tool that can flag up and detect scans, areas of interest and shortlist patients for review. How does the trainee radiologist incorporate that into their decison-making workflow. Can we make expert decisions without being overly-reliant on AI/ML input?

## 2 Early Education

And so the decisions that radiologists and oncologists are making, influenced by AI/ML input whether knowingly or unknowingly, are likely to shape future training pathways. Because the new norm of new patient diagnoses will include an AI/ML opinion on some level of their data.

And so the oncologist looking to make the best decision possible will need an ability communicate and explain the role that AI/ML is having in their workflow. How can they relay this to various appropriate teams e.g. bioinformaticians, computer scientists and mathematicians. How can we build a stronger umbilical cord between the cancer team pulling the treatment trigger and those building better models by the month. The more informed and better-prepared oncologist may have an opinion.
