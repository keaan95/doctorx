## rejection #2
Tough but expected. From Newcastle. Likely a low UKCAT score. It is deflating but nothing new that I can't cope with.

Now onto the fourth module of my Masters in Genomic Medicine. Lots of pretty cool people around. Clinicians, genetic counsellors, senior NHS executives and research scientists. And so one of the most topical conversations is impact. How do you anticipate impacting your field? Research, policy-making, advocacy work, teaching or whatever really. Now's a pretty cool time to begin to think about that. Genomics is cool - particularly in informing individualised risks and stratifying subgroups of treatments to people. Right now, my research is computer-based looking at genetic data that can better identify patients with testicular cancer. Its cool stuff.

The challenge is building a record of implementation work - whether that be research, teaching or some sort of leadership role, will be alongside my job as a junior doctor. Are you ready for it?

Looking back - this is the **more than full-time hustle** of being a doctor. Lots of years of training await - heck im not even trained but all this helps. Helps dig into the deeper reasons for me wanting to do medicine. To act in the interest of others? Deliver on a personal level? Prove people wrong? Proper business sounding cheese. Back to lectures for now.
