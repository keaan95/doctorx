## rejection #4 but interview #2
surely not? a rejection but now an interview? [newcastle](/posts/rejection-two) picked up the phone on clearing day!
\
\
So two days ago, I received an invitation to an interview for 2017 Entry from Newcastle. this is for the five year programme having originally applied to them earlier this year.
\
\
The interview was today and this was actually a phone-based panel interview with two selectors. So I've been trying to cover as much ground for the interview and particularl panel-based topics whilst also addressing some of the areas in which I did not perform so well in at the panel-based Plymouth interview.
\
\
The interview was scheduled for 20 minutes and it went by extremely quickly. The questions were very generic and open-ended. On reflection, I felt that the themes of my responses addressed the questions well but I think I could have delivered the content a bit more succinctly. I felt quite nervous initially when questions were asked based on the content of my responses. The interviewers were very straight-faced and professional so it was hard to tell if these questions were answered properly with strong conviction. Collectively, I felt that I had improved from the Plymouth interview but will this improvement lead to a medical school place?
\
\
Ultimately, there are areas in which I know I need to improve in. Current work as a healthcare assistant is immensely fun - meeting all the other hcas, nurses and doctors. its really a great environment for improving your communication skills, especially when given the responsibility to handover patients to the ward.
