## year two results
Passed.
\
Ranked **234/422**
\
10 OSCE Stations passed.
\
\
A tough year. After a disappointing [january](/posts/highs-and-new-lows), i felt that this year was really about commitment. How badly do you want it. And quite honestly there's nowhere else i'd rather be.
\
\
And for the reason why this is two weeks late:
\
\
Ploughing ahead with the Summer Research Project. Lots of plots, lots of preparation and lots more to learn. My work is now on supervised machine learning rather than previously unsupervised machine learning. Its cool stuff. And I'm excited - oh so similar to Plymouth 2014. Back then, I was working more under instruction and guidance - this time I'm coming up with my own hypotheses. More responsibility.
\
\
But anyway, seeing my ranking is pleasing but I know there is definitely more to come.
\
\
For now, bed for an early start to prepare my data presentations!
