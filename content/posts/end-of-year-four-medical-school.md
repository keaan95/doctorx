### so what did you learn this year eh?
- work life balance
- weekly house meal
- go through the relationship struggle

### work life balance
holy crap online lectures are boring. i mean tbf throughout our entire course all our lectures were recorded. its only now that you have to sit at home and attend them. pre-covid, part of the fun was routine - seeing the boys first thing at 9am. now there's nothing stopping you from buying disney stock at 3am in the morning.

but the real change is regular exercise - regular running and gymn. and to have an active house - we've got the 1st team hockey captain, a muay-thai kick-boxer, rock-climber and dj dale in the house - if you ain't active, you're in the mud. running is a twice weekly activity for me right now and its perfect.

### weekly house meal
every week the lads are pumping out a house meal. we've got thai, greek, american, carribean, japanese, spanish, italian, indian and english. we've split the jobs into starter, two on mains, one on dessert and one can sit-out. these lads can cook.

my baked alaska is still a work in progress.

### go through the relationship struggle
the only way is through. more on this next year.
