## halfway dinner
![image](/images/halfway-dinner.jpg)
Had Halfway Dinner last Tuesday. All the formals so far this year have been so much fun. I mean how often are you gonna get a bunch of scientific nerds to come out for a meal. This one reminded me of Matriculation Dinner when everything felt so new and exciting. New people to meet including the undergrads (the more hardworking than us tbf). Lots of alcohol to plunge into also helps.

Results from my opening two Modules are back:
\
\
**71%** - Introduction to Genomics
\
**61%** - Genomic Sequencing Methods
\
\
The 61% was a painful one. Especially when seeing all your fellow students are consistently hitting 75%+. I actually felt as if I had written as good an essay. However, '80% of the essay was irrelevant.' Brutal.
\
\
And onto happier days. As today, feeling a lot more relaxed and calm about my work and the future. An air of contentness if you will. There's one guy - a durham grad and great mate studying volcanoes. i ask him whether failing to get into cambridge as an undergrad motivated him. nah, just love of the subject. that's the sauce.
