## being useful
at the end of the day - people want to be useful and have a good time. give them a bit of both. bish bash bosh. its gonna be a fun life.

### trying to be useful
when i think back to the best year i had academically, it also was the year I was most useful socially. as an active committee member of the Biomedical Society, as Academic Secretary, back at Plymouth in 2014, you're gonna meet lots of biomed kids and these kids will be excited to meet you. feeling like you're useful or being useful definitely has helped me push on academically. i guess the feeling that your purpose is greater than just slogging out long hours in the library?

and now fast forward to September of 2018, as I begin my post as President of the Newcastle Academic Medicine Society, this is also a time where i'm realising how useful I can be socially. inspiring a committee, providing advice and engaging with presenters. through planning for this opportunity over the summer, my big goal is now - **an Academic Foundation Programme interview**. its really all to play for.

by continuing to try and be a useful student, i really believe i've got a good shot at becoming an academic doctor. all the previous medical schools rejections, tutors and people counting me out - we'll see how this one goes.
