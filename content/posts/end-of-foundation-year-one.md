### 6 takeaways? corr
- consult the consultant
- take care of team boys
- take care of team ward
- just get stuck in
- but bloody behave
- achieve achieve achieve

#### consult the consultant
Consultants loved being consulted. They love questions. Just ask 'em. Better still if you have an interest in their problems - what does a medical director do? And in my head, I'm thinking what on earth what makes me better placed to address the problems these guys have? But that's been the cool part about Island Hospital life. In how many NHS hospitals, would you get the chance as a 10 month old doctor to have regular coffee breaks with directors - medical, surgical, paediatric and emergency. These directors are frankly gangsters. They're just living the gangster life. They've got boats, barbeques and a load of other shit to worry about. You are frankly quite near the bottom of the pile. But hey take a genuine interest in their worries and concerns - how to run a department, how to tangibly and intangibly demonstrate performance of a department, how to keep colleagues happy - some of this stuff might be useful one day, in your own future.

#### take care of team boys
There's a key rule in the lads [racket](/posts/lad-culture). Never kick a man when he's down. Let him get back up. And kick him again. But in all honesty, the boys will go through ups and downs. Similar to you - old boy - although you'll try and hide yours. But offer him a hand - a bit of help coz frankly you'll need it one day too.

#### take care of team ward
the team the team the team. The nurses, hcas, salt, physio, ots, dieticians, clerks and even the stinky doctors. Because when the team works well - you'll work well. And of course, it will make it way easier to get those pesky sign-offs.

#### experience > theory
as a housemate once said - 'less talking, more doing.' That housemate is actually an acute medical consultant serving as acting medical director. But fancy words aside, the message is clear. The more you get stuck in - the more you'll learn. That reminds me - how's my hinge going.

#### but bloody behave
set your own limits. Its full-time working life with a bunch of people you'll probably chat shit with on the weekends too. There's no tutor ready to pull you in after being driven home in the boot of your mate's car. Get a bike.

#### achieve achieve achieve
This sounds rather preachy. But as agreed with Dr Feather - when you're young - you can either travel or achieve crazy shit. Win that parkrun on all the island courses. Run that marathon and a set a target time bet with your consultant. Cash-in that Â£125 and make him sign a poster confirming this happened. Whatever you do - just think about what's bigger than this. What's the next achievement?
