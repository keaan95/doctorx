## the story of mike (not his real name)

so a fourth year student was in the department this week. the acute medical department. on appearance and vibe - reminded me of a mate - big up wing - a 30 year old lad - lovely guy but not been on too many dates. great potential - but i don't think the world's quite seen it.

anyway. so this guy would come in everyday. does his little bit. shadow the consultant and nod along. 

so one day we went for lunch. i'm in my church sermon mood. i'm gonna sprinkle some wisdom on this guy.

so i've asked all my mates at university - across biomed, cambridge and medschool. what is the one thing you wish you did more of - you still did it - you wish did more of. the biomed boys were work harder. yeah fair but that isn't gonna sell. the cambridge boys were sleep more and work less hard. right. and so the medschool boys and gals said more societies.

so i told him join to do more societies and clubs - the rando interest you have - just go for it. you'll find your closest mates in the most unlikely of places and the best way to find them - just get out the front door.

anyway, mid spaghetti munch. the kid's like - so what is the one thing *you* wish you did more of. ah shit. spent my entire life asking others questions now this guy's trying to make me think.

i sat there and said. ask girls out. do it. the first time it will be crap. but guess what. in one week who's gonna care. in one month who's gonna care. in one year who's gonna care. okay lydia might remember but you get the drift.

so next week. mike comes up to me. i did your homework. mouth half open. so this kid goes out on a friday to the student nightclub - on a friday karaoke - by himself! - and gets chatting to someone. asks them for a drink sometime. the girl politely declines. 

and i looked at this guy. the madlad did it. by himself! he tells me the whole story with a smile on his face.

two days later - the kid's packing up. mike's like - ah im heading off the island. placement's over. well best of luck - you've got a great future ahead of you. like a proud dad waving goodbye to his uni son.

holy shit 


## back in 2019
back in 2019, i chatted about [fear of failure](/posts/fear-of-failure) - i think richard osman said it best - in everything you do in life - you're going to inevitably fail - so fail *well*.
