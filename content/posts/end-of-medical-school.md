## end of medical school

![image](/images/final-year.jpg)

### so on the wine now?
- strengths
- Achievements and ambition
- Trust your gut. Speak get opinion. Even better to have someone who give you the opposite.
- Self defeating attitudes and behaviours. 
- That 10k awaits
- Girls > guys about feelings
- The care givers - protect them. Every groups got em. The guy or gal who has sound advice. The mum of the group. That person needs extra love because they give out so much of it. Big ups to Natalie and Hannah - unbelievably selfless.
- Belief is all you need

#### the breakfast club
self-defeating attitudes and behaviours
#### learn from others
college has been so much fun. but what's made it fun has been the people. along with all the formals, summer garden parties, weekday club nights - its the regular sitdown meals with the lads. everyone's slogging it out - working to deadlines and you may not see a guy for a couple of weeks - but those moments together were so special. it was simply effortless conversation.

##### so what was the chat?
well one time with a mate. we came from formal and just hanging out in the foyer. he's like man 'if you can't be the smartest, if you can't be the best-looking, then what are you?' i didn't really have an answer at the time. but i think i'd aim to be the most happy.


##### there will always be someone smarter than you
there will be always be someone smarter than you. someone who can grasp concepts, synthesise ideas quicker than you. you simply shouldn't let that affect you.

#### learn ahead
just noticed that if i did a bit of work before a module - it really did reflect in my marks at the end. the material is dense and churning through it is hard if you haven't some basic ideas of what's going on. may have taken me four years of uni to really realise this but yep i'm glad i appreciate it now.

#### did you make Top of the Class?
did not finish top of the class. the guy that did smashed final year and his averages were closer to 80% - exceedingly impressive. i may have had the willingness and work ethic, but routine and revision habits weren't so refined.

and in truth, the very fact of setting such an ambitious goal has still meant i've had some success - a [first class](/posts/biomed-chapter-five) degree and a [masters acceptance](/posts/biomed-chapter-six) at cambridge. shoot for the moon and all that.
