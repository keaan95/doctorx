## lad culture
'doctorx, did you rizz at the [isle of wight festival](/posts/island-festivities). 'sainath, i have no idea what you're talking about'
\
\
you've sat in a pub before. you've heard many a youngun spout this nonsense. and objectively it is nonsense. but to the lads - its a phrase signalling a way of culture. this is **lad culture.**


### foreword
now i'm not an expert on lad culture. i'm not an expert on lad psychology. i'm not even a lad. all i can comment on is my observations.

#### definition
{{< quote info >}}
`lad culture` (from Middle English ladde (“foot soldier, servant; male commoner; boy”)) - the culture of refering to collective, boorish or misogynistic behaviour by young heterosexual men, particularly university students.

to be fair that is bang on.

**Disclaimer**:  if you're a lad, what you're about to read may be highly disrespectful, pointless or enlightening. please use this information at your own discretion.

#### rules of lad culture
so there are two general observed rules of lad culture.

1. prod the lad, roast the lad but never undermine a lad - particularly in courtship settings
2. and never kick a lad when he's down. let him get him get back up. and kick him again.


#### an example of lad culture
we have a young man. been in a long-term relationship. unfortunately bam - he's split from his wife. two months later, he's getting involved. he's back sailing. his housemate notices the man's back. the man's in flow. he's got his shirt on. he's smiling on the boats. he's loving life.
\
\
on the group chat - the public sailing group chat avec consultants, a charming picture of three sailors appear. our boy sainath. one hour later 'bloody hell - could've given me a warning - that guy's bloody clapped!'
\
\
now then, doctorx is in mum mode. i'm prepped a diffuse comment - 'so is that the fun boat?' - but mum mode also wants his son to reply. please fight back. please fight back. its huw. he's up for it.
\
\
sai replies back 'taking note of everyone reacting to this' with a middle finger emoji. okay, not bad. not terrible. but in the public group chat, this was a huge violation and in working life, there ain't no referees and there ain't no easy to reach mums.

#### so what are you on about?
so lad culture is centered around one-upping each other. whether its boat size, dick size, shoe size. its just 'what have you got - have you got something better?'

#### what was the point of lad culture again?
just back the boys - whether by intention or action. till the bitter end - okay you may not see or get results - but trust that kindness will win. okay, my boy sai got killed. but guess what. in a week. maybe someone will bring it up. in a month. probably no one's gonna bring it up. in a year. no one's gonna bring it up. in two years. okay, i'm gonna bring it up.
\
\
and that's it. so long as the group's having fun - its banter not bullying right?
