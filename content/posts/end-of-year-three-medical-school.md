## end of year three medical school.
![image](/images/third-year.jpg)
stinks of a bunch of keen bean clinical years

### so what did you learn this year eh?
- active learning
- go for a run or nap
- collabs
- fallouts will be inevitable

#### active learning
i still have no idea what this exactly means but just continually asking why. why does this condition present in this way. real-life snapshots of conditions help build a picture but understanding why helps it stick.

#### go for a run or nap
clinical medicine is a bit mentally taxing. i remember the first clinical reasoning session was on a case that looked like multiple sclerosis but the examiner was like - what other conditions - could this case be. all that thinking was so mentally taxing. just thinking about many options in a short period of time. at the end of the day - i could go for a nap or a run. i decided to go for a run this year.

#### collabs
collaborate, collaborate, collaborate. even as a way to generate ideas. people will be excited to work on something that is completely different. our haem-onco emergencies day was something completely different.

#### fallouts will be inevitable
despite letting go of academic medicine society work, i've been motoring with haematology and oncology society work. anyway so part of collaborating is also sharing and communicating ideas. i've definitely learnt the importance of this - especially with people you've got a working relationship with. people like their ideas. people like to see their ideas worked on and adapted on. just keep them informed.

## where next
