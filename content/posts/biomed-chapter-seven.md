## end of final year biomed

no images today - i did not attend graduation :)


### so too cool for graduation eh?
- just gotta prove them wrong
- the team the team the team
- respect the elders
- did you make Top of the Class?

#### Prove them Wrong or Prove you Right
Factors outside of your control will impact you and possibly your performance. Despite a second year average of 73.5% and first year score of 68% - I was predicted a 2:1 by my tutor. A 2:1 prediction took me out of a medical school interview at plymouth. That was hard.
\
\
In my head, my mind flashed back to school when I was predicted BCC at A-Level - taking me out of the race completely for a medical school place as a school-leaver.
\
\
Years later - really glad I went through that experience. Of course, ending up with the [first class](/posts/biomed-chapter-five) degree was satisfying but maintaining self-belief and strong working relationships with my supervisors what i'm more proud of. it still pisses me off that this happened. But I respect their process and judgement. corr that was heavy.

#### the team the team the team
uni is just an amazing network of amazing people. the hardest part i've found is when you lose people. people who drop-out, people who change degrees or people who just move on. it really makes you appreciate the team - the team - the team.
\
\
one of our modules this year required weekly group presentations - eight in total. my team consisted of a few biomeds i'd never met before. and one of the teams had a biomed - who was top of the class - <strike>i</strike> we had to beat him. looking back, it was incredibly enjoyable working with a group of people each week - dominos in the library - up till 11pm on a thursday - trying to put out the best presentations possible. even if we kicked off a trend of including 'inspirational tweets' from our lecturers. we did end up becoming the best performing group and it proved to me, doesn't matter who the people are, you just gotta take on who you've got and go for it.

#### respect the elders
i chat so much shit. none more so than with the mature students. 'mate you're sooo old!' years later - i feel their pain. but these mature students - okay they have a stereotype - probably wearing the latest winter range of abercrombie, got a satchel and a hidden pair of glasses that only comes out during a practical - they are amazingly fun to get to know. jed, christian, david, kati.
\
\
a sprinkle of insight into their lifestyle - eating fish twice a week, regular kick-boxing, future phd plans. they've been through the rodeo of pissing about at uni or in early life, and have a commitment to work which is reflected also in their routine. its funny whenever i'm in a juncture in life i often think *what would this mature student* do.

#### did you make Top of the Class?
did not finish top of the class. the guy that did smashed final year and his averages were closer to 80% - exceedingly impressive. i may have had the willingness and work ethic, but routine and revision habits weren't so refined.
\
\
and in truth, the very fact of setting such an ambitious goal has still meant i've had some success - a [first class](/posts/biomed-chapter-five) degree and a possible [masters](/posts/biomed-chapter-six). shoot for the moon and all that.
