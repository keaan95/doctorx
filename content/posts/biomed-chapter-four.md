## four rejections but a welcome
a welcome to my blog - previously titled 'Hunting Medicine' at the time of writing this, i was a third year / final year biomedical science student at plymouth university. still clinging onto hope of studying medicine. this is the account of me back then. a bit cheesy but hey it is the more competitive me.

since 2016, a few diary entries have been re-written more in my [writing style](/posts/writing-style) - however the core text remains the same. don't believe me - check out the original untouched blog [here](https://huntingmedicine.blogspot.com).


#### Scores
GAMSAT score: 56
\
UKCAT score: 635

#### Outcomes
Exeter University - low GAMSAT
\
Plymouth University - low GAMSAT
\
St George's University - low GAMSAT
\
Nottingham University - low GAMSAT
\
\
So, 2017 Entry it is. I have three modules left this semester in the final year of my degree and decisions about what I plan to do next year will be made soon. It is disappointing to be rejected because of low aptitude test scores but I know I can do better next year and I'm still hopeful of a high enough degree prediction to perhaps warrant an interview.

This is my third attempt at writing up a blog. I felt as if my previous two were rather verbose and overly scientific. Let's see how this journey goes.
