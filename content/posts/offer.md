## offer?
so newcastle cameback with an [interview](/posts/rejection-five) after initially rejecting me earlier in the cycle. can't say this is the typical route to medicine.
\
\
anyway mid-shift (second one actually) in A&E saw the notification...
\
\
**'Further to your recent interview for a place on the A100 MBBS programme at Newcastle University, I am pleased to inform you that we would like to make you an unconditional offer for 2017 entry. Please find the offer letter attached here.'**
\
\
Just so fulfilling to know that all this work was worth it. All the lectures, essays and dissertations have all come resulted in a dream being fulfilled. Just so grateful to all my close friends, family members and lecturers over the past year for all their support. also big shoutout to the nurse in charge for letting me call my mum.

The best days are still ahead!
