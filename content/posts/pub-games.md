pub games are cracking. they can be notoriously good fun. they can be notoriously cruel. the best games have a bit of both.

we also love pub games as a means of drinking. but how about pub games as a means of thinking?

- chats about health, finances, relationships and careers. should always be on the itinerary tbf
- re-enacting sky sports skits.
- anything the rugby guys can think of.

### easy fruit pub games
- rank your flatmates
- favourite thing about the person to your left
- most recent text
- 1 on 1 q&a (non-romantic - entirely platonic) with one person - who is it?
- lose all social media and keep one app - what is it
- build a three man team of zombie fighters

### juicy fruit pub games
