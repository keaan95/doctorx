## well goodbye uni
![image](/images/final-year.jpg)
that's it? surely you've got some shit to say.

### over nine years of uni what you learnt then?
mate **mental health** is real. maybe i wasn't aware of it back in 2014. a bunch of biomed bros. but if i had to estimate - 1 in 2 of my uni mates have a diagnosed or are currently managing a mental health condition - be it depression, anxiety or anything else really. its prevalent and needs to be talked about more.

#### so how do you deal with it?
well good people. good people associate themselves with good people. its funny - when you see someone in the year group. a little bit of your assessment of them is by who they hang out with. if the people they're hanging out - are objectively good people - well guess what - more than likely that's a good person.

#### right what's a good person?
someone that listens to others. don't be forceful. don't be stubborn. give others an opportunity to speak. and better still - pay attention to those who don't speak - they might be introverted and guess what introverted people will have useful shit to say because they spend more of their time thinking rather than speaking. maybe something i should try
\
\
good people also encourage others. its the small things. its the compliments. guys don't give other guys compliments - nearly as much as girls - but when you do - its fucking real. so yep dish it out.
\
\
trying to do good for the purpose of being good can be energy consuming. so be you. just be aware people will care for you - just give them back what they put in.

### so nine years are up - what have i learnt?
just be authentic - be you. nothing can replace it - and if you stinks - soz mate sort it out

flat harmony - [build it](/posts/end-of-year-one-medical-school)
\
\
be instinctive - if something feels right - then it probably is. you feel like a run? [just go for it man](/posts/end-of-year-three-medical-school).

#### and what are you gonna do differently
- Be impeccable with your word. You'll chat shit daily but emphasise the points that you wanna make sure stick.
- Not everyone has to like you - it's actually quite self-defeating to aim for that
- Ask others what they would do - others have great perspectives and often more experiences - listen attentively.
- Sleep well and listen to your head, not just your body. If you feel tired mentally - that will affect your body.
- Continue to have fun. can't compete against someone having fun.
