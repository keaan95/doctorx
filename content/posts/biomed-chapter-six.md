## masters classification

#### Final Year Scores
Before my hopeful 2017 entrance to Medical School, I have applied to do a one-year Masters in Genomic Medicine ('Modern' Medical Genetics apparently) at the following universities:
\
\
St George's (offer)
\
Imperial (interview -> offer)
\
Cambridge (interview...)
#### Cambridge...
Heading down the escalator in M&S Kingston, glanced at the phone - email notification with **'University of Cambridge conditional offer of Admission.'**
\

Pretty cool. I actually sat on the news until evening. Told my parents at dinner. My mum asks why aren't you excited? I just knew there's hard work to come. I know from sister, who did NatSci at Churchill - how big of a transition Cambridge is - not purely the workload. But internally, I was so excited, intrigued to see which College I would be at.
\
\
It may not be medical school but doing a summer research studentship after the first year of my undergraduate degree really helped fuel my enthusiasm for research and interest in cancer genomics. Having a little bit of experience in computational biology, probably helped my application despite having long-term medical school ambitions.

I'll leave the cheesy thank yous out for now.
