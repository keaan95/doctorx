*the year is 2042 and the local train station has not aged a day*

### welcome to consumerism in 2042
the age where your ideas are no longer solved but sold. the age where ssris are the new haribos. the age where help2buy means help2fundtomytriptopisa.

#### definition
{{< quote info >}}
`consumerism` (from Urban Dictionary) - is the practice of conspicuously buying flashy, expensive items and expecting them to fill the voids in one's life

## four stages
kubler-ross has the five stages of grief, we'll stay optimistic and declare the four steps of the consumer:

1. healthy boy
2. unexpected challenge
3. dip into the overdraft
4. the knight in shining armour


### 1. healthy boy consumerism
consumerism is quite healthy actually. fancy a new pair of nike supershoes, that hybrid bike on cycle2work or the latest samsung noise-cancelling headphones? congratulations you're now me. but really its people's money and they can do what they want with it and play whatever games they like

### 2. unexpected consumerism

the majority of our spend is probably for conveniences - the groceries, the bills, the streaming subscriptions - a combination of things we need and want. sadly we also have to pay for inconveniences - crappy wifi, selling crappy furniture that got leaked on or i guess smashing a lego spaceship into a wall.

### 3. the overdraft
so you've spent healthily - or seemingly so and bam unexpected fees are due. there's no free parking on this monopoly board and you definitely haven't got any properties to mortgage. its 2042 - you ain't got savings so its on the groupchat. sorry lads can't play footgolf today. i'm broke.

### 4. the saviour

the dad in the group will cover you - at least temporarily so. bish bash bosh. and before you know it, you're back home after gallivanting in the lads' twenty year old yaris. after a solid cup of milk in the evening, you look ahead to the next month. ah junior doctor strike dates are out. perfect. but wait do i still get paid?
