## Our 4 Aims

- How will AI and ML really impact and clinically improve cancer helthcare?
- How can we overcome current and future limitations of delivering healthcare with artificial intelligence?
- How can we best prepare future professionals for working within oncology?
- What steps can we make to support and develop artificial intelligence systems in clinical practice?

## Join Us

To help prepare us for this, we are recruiting university students from mathematical, statistical, computer science, medical, biomedical and theoretical degree backgrounds to take part in a co-ordinated fortnightly effort to review the latest and most reliable evidence-base forms of artificial intelligence research. We will publish our weekly reports and perspectives to Doctorx.co.uk and to leading researchers globally.

[Join our team](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=yRJQnBa2wkSpF2aBT74-h4_904xzEU1Hr6_KZJuPREVUMVBXUzZaRVpIMktET1dEWTI0TlBXR0NBTC4u). Students of any degree background and experience level are very welcome to become part of DoctorX. We are planning to release regular articles, journal club excerpts and video discussions.
